# Experiment with `TorchText` and `PyTorch`, and made a Sentiment classification model

I have tried to explore the `TorchText` library using kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis.

I only focussed here to explore the different things, not on accuracy of the model. For that, I did not used full dataset and not performed the raw text processing here.

Main code is written in `main.py` file and data processing code is written in `data_process.py` file. Main experiment was done in Jupyter notebook `rough_experiment.ipynb` file, and after that all codes written in organized manner in `VS code`.  

### Another Repository Link
I have made a proper `Sentiment Analysis Model` using PyTorch with `modular coding approach`, link is given here https://github.com/Kousik-Sasmal/tweeter-sentiment-using-pytorch-torchtext.
